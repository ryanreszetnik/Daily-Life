I have not been able to find an application that I really liked to plan out my day and keep track of things. This is a work in progress application that has the goal of keeping me orgainzed all in one place (mainly for school). Currently it acts as a weekly calendar, and a way to keep track of assignments and tests for each course.

Some other features that will be implemented in the future include calculating marks for courses, planning meals (with recommendations if I'm feeling fancy), daily goals, reminders, tracking spending etc.
